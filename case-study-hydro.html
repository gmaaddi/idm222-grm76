                The proposed app is called Hydro Habits, which helps users set hydration goals, choose from various types of drinks, and track their water intake. Hydro Habits also calculates the water content in each drink users consume, helping them on their way to achieving their hydration goal.

                To better understand what is typical of a water hydration app, the research process included downloading thirteen different hydration apps from the App Store. Analyzing these different applications revealed the possible actions for users, how users go about performing these actions, and common imagery, including water glasses, water droplets, and water bottles.

                Next, the best sketch ideas were chosen to develop into wireframes. <b>The wireframes were then used to create a wire flow, indicating which elements triggered a transition to a new screen.</b> 
                From the home screen, users can tap the plus button, which transitions to a new page to select a drink. On the Select Drink screen, users can either add a recently selected drink, which will return them to an updated home screen, or select from the drinks featured prominently in the middle of the screen. If one of the prominently featured drinks is selected, the user will be taken to the Add Drink screen. To complete the process of adding a drink, the check button must be tapped. At this point, the user will either receive a notification that they met their hydration goal or they will be returned to the home screen with the updated hydration total and appearance of the drink they just added in the “Today’s Drinks” section.

            <p>
                The interaction guides provided detailed descriptions of which animations occurred on each screen and how they would appear once animated. Major animation decisions were made in this stage, such as the appearance of the preset amount bubbles and how the bubbles would transition in and out when the goal message appears. For the preset amount bubbles, the goal was to find a solution that made the selected preset amount have more emphasis than the other preset amounts, but the struggle was finding a way to make the other bubbles appear clickable at a lower opacity. It was ultimately decided that the selected preset amount bubble would have black text, and the other bubbles would appear at 75% opacity with blue text. For the goal message animation, the goal was to find a way for the check button to be noticeable on a screen where small bubbles would continuously float upwards, which could be distracting when looking for a specific button. Removing the check mark entirely was considered, and in this case, users would tap the message bubble to make the bubbles disappear. While this idea was not chosen, it led to the idea to attach the check button to the message bubble since it would be prominently featured in the center of the screen and the bubbles would float behind it.

                The completed designs were then transferred from Figma to Adobe After Effects where the interaction process could be animated.
                <b>After one week, the core animations were blocked out, but the timing was inconsistent throughout and too fast to see everything that was on a screen.</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                Since the first draft of animations was a long, complex file, it was easier to start with a blank document and use the first draft as a reference for which items needed to be animated.
                <b>Consistent timing was established</b> after the second week <b>by keeping a notebook including the frame numbers where elements appeared and disappeared from view and the length of these animations.</b>
                The second draft also <b>introduced a bubble popping sound effect when the message bubble shrinks to simulate the bubble popping.</b>

                <b>Minor changes were made before the final animation, focusing on when certain elements animate in relation to others.</b>
                It was determined that numbers should appear immediately in the glass before the water moves up in the glass on the Add Drink screen. Also, when selecting a preset amount, the number in the glass should change before the opacity and color changes of the preset amount bubbles. Finally, when the text and the drinks appear on the Select Drink screen, the timing was altered to ensure that the text landed in place when the drink icons had already finished their transition. All of these decisions were made to ensure that users would not have to wait to perform certain actions. For example, users can now tap on the check mark button before the water glass animation finishes and select a drink icon without having to wait for the rest of the text on the page to appear.

                The completed Hydro Habits project demonstrates how users can go about completing a simple task through a simple design. 
                <b>Much consideration was given to how the water-like aesthetic could aid in the users’ interaction with the application.</b>
                Selecting a drink icon would cause the drink to shake with the liquid shifting accordingly, adding ounces of water would cause the water to fill the glass to a certain amount, and small bubbles floated in a seemingly random formation while a larger bubble popped. This proposed application stands out from other applications due to its intentional use of water-like imagery with natural, accompanying water-like actions. 
                <b>The complex animations ultimately enhance the users’ experience without complicating how the users go about performing the actions that align with their task to record drinks to fulfill their hydration goal.</b>
